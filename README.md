# MediCare
During my internship in Hackveda.ltd, I had designed and developed a doctor's appointment page for a medical facility using a range of web development tools.I used figma to create a visual prototype of the website. Next, I used HTML, CSS and Javascript to develop the frontend of the website, then used PHP for the backend part.
